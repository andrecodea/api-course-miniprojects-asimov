# Python Mini Projects Collection

[üáßüá∑ Vers√£o em Portugu√™s](README-pt.md)

A simple collection of three interactive Python web applications built with Streamlit, demonstrating API integration, data visualization, and real-world problem solving. These projects were proposed by teacher **Juliano Faccioni** during the APIs for beginners course at **Asimov Academy**

## üéØ Projects Overview
This repository contains three distinct mini-projects that demonstrate various Python capabilities:

1. **üå§Ô∏è Weather Web App** - Real-time weather information using OpenWeatherMap API
2. **üéµ Spotify Web App** - Artist search and top tracks discovery using Spotify Web API
3. **üìä Names by Decade App** - Brazilian name frequency analysis using IBGE data

### Required Environment Variables:
The API keys for all miniprojects should be stored in a .env file and imported individualy using python-dotenv.

```bash
OPEN_WEATHER_API="YOUR KEY"
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID="YOUR CID"
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR CS"
```
